# Proejct_Evaluation_System
The Team Project Evaluation System is a Django web app for managing and evaluating student projects. It allows coordinators to manage teams, students to upload phase-specific materials, and panelists to evaluate projects using detailed rubrics. With role-based dashboards and phase-wise tracking, it streamlines project assessment efficiently.
